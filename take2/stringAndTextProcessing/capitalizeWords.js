/*
Capitalize Words
Write a function that takes a string as an argument, and returns that string 
with the first character of every word capitalized and all subsequent characters 
in lowercase.

You may assume that a word is any sequence of non-whitespace characters.

Notes:
- input is a string
- output is a string with each word's 0th index converted to uppercase 
  and other other chars converted to lowerCase

Examples:

wordCap('four score and seven');       // "Four Score And Seven"
wordCap('the javaScript language');    // "The Javascript Language"
wordCap('this is a "quoted" word');    // 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

Algorithm:
- split the string into the array of words
- iterate over the words
  - transform each word[0] index value to uppercase 
  - concat slice of the array from 1st index to lowercase
- join the array of words back to a string
*/

let wordCap = str => {
  return str
    .split(' ')
    .map(word => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())
    .join(' ');
}

console.log(wordCap('four score and seven'));       // "Four Score And Seven"
console.log(wordCap('the javaScript language'));       // "The Javascript Language"
